# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators



# 1. Arithmetic operators
# a = 2
# b = 5
# print("sum =", a + b)
# print("sub =", b - a)
# print("mult =", b*a)
# print("div =", b/a)
# print("modulus =", b%a)    # reminder on division
# print("expo =", b**a)
# print("floor =", b//a)


# 2. Assignment operators
# a = 5 
# a += 2
# a -= 2
# a *= 2
# a /= 2
# a %= 2
# a //= 2
# a **= 2
# a &= 2
# a |= 2
# a ^= 2
# a >>= 2
# a <<= 2


# 3. Comparision operators
# a = 2 
# b = 3
# print(b == a)
# print(b != a)
# print(b > a)
# print(b < a)
# print(b >= a)
# print(b <= a)


# 4. Logical operators
# a = 2 
# b = 3
# c = 5
# d = 10
# print( (b > a) and (d > c) )               # JS = &&
# print( (a > b) or (d > c) )                # JS = ||
# print( not(a>b or d>c) )                   # JS = not


# 5. Identity operators
# a = 2
# b = 2 
# c = 5
# print(a is b)            # both variables are same object
# print(a is not b)        # both variables are not same object


# 6. Membership operators
# a = [10, 20, 30, 40]
# x = 20
# print(x in a)
# print(x not in a)
