--------------------  range()  ---------------------

range() = function is used to generate a sequence of integers starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 by default,
          till j-1.

Syntaxt = 
          range(start, stop, stepsize)


start = Starting position. If we do not mention start by default it's 0

stop = Ending position. The range of integers stops one element prior to stop. If stop is j then will stop at exact j-1

stepsize = Increment by stepsize. If we do not mention start by default it's 1.
